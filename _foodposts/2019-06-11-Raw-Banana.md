## Helloooo Again Foodies!!! 
Don't be disheartened by the title, I promise its worth it.

If you are a foodie like me, trying out various dishes and recipes, plus a "vegetarian" you know that Raw banana is a mild replacement for
potatoes. So today's dish is [Raw-Banana-Stir-Fry](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/raw-banana-stir-fry-recipe/).

Do check it out, it has an elaborate explanation of each step. I followed each step and it turned out pretty good.

It's a very low effort dish and if you are bachelor/bachelorette it is something you would wanna include in your easy-to-make
dish. So go ahead, try out the recipe link and let me know how it goes.
