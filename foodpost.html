    <p>
        For a really long time, I had been trying to do this. You would be shocked if I say that there is no one in this planet that can say
        "I don't like eating". So I am person who usually doesn't eat meat. I know its sad and I am missing out on a lot but trust me when I say this that 
        there is a like a lot to explore on the vegetarian side. It will take me a lifetime to explore all possible dishes but I hope to cover atleast half way 
        till I die. 
        This is my attempt to consolidate all the recepies I cook and mark them as done on my check list.
